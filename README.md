## Problem : Immune Immunity
- Our immune system is made up of special cells, tissues, and organs that work together to protect you.
- Our immune system is Our bodyâ€™s defense against infections and other harmful invaders. Without it, we would constantly get sick from bacteria or viruses.
- When our immune system doesn't work the way it should, it is called an immune system disorder.
- White blood cells are the cells of the immune system. They are made in one of our lymph organs, the bone marrow. Other lymph organs include the spleen and thymus
